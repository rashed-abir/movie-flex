Movie Flex is a website which has many movies. You can read the ratings, description of any movie. Also you can search for a movie name to see this information. This website will give you the right information and you can find out before seeing the movie. I have fetched this data from an API link which I collect from the IMDB website. I have used functional based components or react hooks in this site.
